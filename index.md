## Manifesto

I studied pure mathematics in college because I enjoy solving problems
elegantly. As a designer-developer, I solve problems according to this principle
by using existing open source tools and not reinventing the wheel. To be an
effective programmer is to understand how to [manage and reduce complexity][3].
While working at a large software company I learned the value of breaking code
into *services* to help achieve this. Design should communicate inherent value.
[Death to bullshit][1]. Don't *over-design*  things. The world needs more
things that are designed like Craigslist and Reddit. I believe in breaking down
the barriers between the people who design things and the people who write code.
