### Manifesto

I studied pure mathematics in college because I enjoy solving problems
elegantly. I use existing tools to solve these problems instead of reinventing
the wheel. While working at a large software company I learned the value of
breaking code into *services* to reduce complexity. Don't *over-design* things.
Design should communicate inherent value.  [Death to bullshit][1]. The world
needs more things that are designed like Craigslist and Reddit.
