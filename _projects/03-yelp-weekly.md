I co-designed and built Yelp's Weekly email which is sent to several million users each week. This was a mobile-first email design project, which was challenging considering the [extreme limitations of HTML email][1]. This project led to a further overhaul of Yelp's entire HTML email template inventory, where I was the lead developer.  Check out the [desktop version][2].
